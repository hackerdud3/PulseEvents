# PulseEvents

This is a full-stack web application for managing events. The application is built using Spring Boot, Spring Security, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring BootðŸš€**: Developed the backend structure and RESTful API endpoints.
- **JavaðŸš€**: Employed Java for core application logic and backend development in conjunction with the Spring Boot framework.
- **Spring SecurityðŸš€**: Configured spring security and implemented JWT authentication.
- **Next.jsðŸš€**: Used React Framework for building the frontend.
- **TypeScriptðŸš€**: Ensures type safety throughout the application.
- **Tailwind CSSðŸš€**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the UI.
- **ReactðŸš€**: Library for building the user interface.
- **ReduxðŸš€**: For managing global state, allowing centralized control of the application state, efficiency, and scalability within the react application.
- **MongoDBðŸš€**: NoSQL database for storing user, role, and event information.
- **DockerðŸš€**: Dockerized for easy deployment and development.
- **VercelðŸš€**: For deployment
- **ComponentsðŸš€**: tremor

## Features
- Secure authentication using Spring Security and JWT Authentication (JSON Web Tokens).
- Role-based authorization for different user roles (e.g., admin, user, mod).
- Input validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- Implemented Login/Signup components, protected routes, and context-based authentication on the frontend.
- Moderators can create new events with details like event name, venue, date, time, etc and also edit the events.
- Users can view the events and click on the interested button if they are interested.
- The events that are expired are not displayed.
- The total number of users interested, Event name, Venue, Date, and time are displayed in the event context along with the image.
- Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent and efficient deployment of applications across various environments
